Cantera should build 'out of the box' on linux, cygwin, Mac OS X, and
Solaris. It should build on most other variants of unix with some
tweaking. The build process runs a few Python scripts, so you need to
have Python present whether or not you plan to install the Cantera
Python interface. Linux and Mac OS X have python pre-installed; many
other systems have it too. If yours does not, you can get it at
www.python.org.


Build Instructions
==================

To build and install Cantera in /usr/local:

./configure
make 
make install


To build and install Cantera in a different directory:

./configure --prefix=/installation/dir
make
make install

Here '/installation/dir' should be replaced with the absolute path to
the installation directory.

To do 'make install', you may need to be super-user. On a Mac running
OS X, type 'sudo make install'


Configuring the Environment
---------------------------

Execute script 'cantera/setup_cantera' to configure the environment for Cantera:
source /usr/local/cantera/setup_cantera


The Python Interface
--------------------

If Python 2.x is installed, and the Numeric package is installed, then
the Cantera Python interface will be built and installed.


The MATLAB Toolbox
------------------

If MATLAB is present, the MATLAB toolbox will be built and installed.


Customizing
-----------

Before running configure, the following environment variables may be set:

MAKE                     set to 'make' utility compatible with GNU make

CXX                      C++ compiler

F77                      Fortran 77 compiler

PYTHON_CMD               Python interpreter to use with Cantera 
                         (default: 'python')

MATLAB_CMD               Matlab command (default: 'matlab')

Additional customization can be done by editing the configure script.
