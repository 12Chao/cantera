Cantera should build 'out of the box' on linux, cygwin, Mac OS X, and
Solaris. It should build on most other variants of unix with some
tweaking. The build process runs a few Python scripts, so you need to
have Python present whether or not you plan to install the Cantera
Python interface. Linux and Mac OS X have python pre-installed; many
other systems have it too. If yours does not, you can get it at
www.python.org.


====================================================================
                        Build Instructions
====================================================================

To build Cantera and install it in /usr/local:

./configure
make 
make install

To do 'make install', you may need to be super-user, or may need to
preface 'make install' by 'sudo' ('sudo make install').

Cantera applications will be put in /usr/local/bin, libraries will be
installed in a version-specific subdirectory of
/usr/local/lib/cantera, unix man pages will be installed under
/usr/share/man, C++ header files will be installed in
/usr/local/include/cantera, and various demos and data files will be
installed in subdirectories of /usr/local/cantera.


To install Cantera in a different directory:

./configure --prefix=/installation/dir
make
make install

Here '/installation/dir' should be replaced with the absolute path to
the installation directory. For example, to install in your home directory:

./configure --prefix=$HOME
make
make install

In this case, subdirectories bin, lib, include, man, and cantera will
be created within your home directory if they don't exist already, and
cantera will be installed into these directories.



Configuring the Environment
---------------------------

The build process will create an initialization script 'cantera.rc'. Type 

source /usr/local/cantera/cantera.rc 

to set the environment for Cantera. Alternatively, copy cantera.rc to your
home directory as .cantera, and add the line

source .cantera

to your login script.



The Python Interface
--------------------

If Python 2.x is installed, and the Numeric package is installed, then
the Cantera Python interface will be built and installed.


The MATLAB Toolbox
------------------

If MATLAB is present, the MATLAB toolbox will be built and installed.


Customizing
-----------

Before running configure, the following environment variables may be set:

MAKE                     set to 'make' utility compatible with GNU make

CXX                      C++ compiler

F77                      Fortran 77 compiler

PYTHON_CMD               Python interpreter to use with Cantera 
                         (default: 'python')

MATLAB_CMD               Matlab command (default: 'matlab')

Additional customization can be done by editing the configure script
before running it.
