Cantera should build 'out of the box' on linux, cygwin, and Mac OS
10.2. It should build on most other variants of unix with some
tweaking. The build process runs a few Python scripts, so you need to
have Python present whether or not you plan to install the Cantera
python interface. Linux and Mac OS 10.2 have python pre-installed.


Build Instructions
==================

To build and install Cantera in /usr/local:

./configure
make 
make install


To build and install Cantera in a different directory:

./configure --prefix=/installation/dir
make
make install

To do 'make install', you may need to be super-user. On a Mac running
OS X, type 'sudo make install'



Customizing
-----------

Before running configure, the following environment variables may be set:

CXX                      C++ compiler

F77                      Fortran 77 compiler

BUILD_PYTHON_MODULE      build the Cantera Python interface  ('y' or 'n')

BUILD_MATLAB_TOOLBOX     build the Matlab toolbox ('y' or 'n')

PYTHON_CMD               Python interpreter to use with Cantera (default: 'python')
                         You must have write access to the
                         'site-packages' directory of this Python
                         interpreter if you are installing the Cantera
                         Python interface, and it must have the
                         'Numeric' package installed.

Additional customization can be done by editing the configure script.
